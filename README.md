# Aggregates and Grouping

This repository contains SQL exercises focusing on **aggregates and grouping** using **MySQL Workbench** and the **Northwind** sample database. The exercises are designed to practice key SQL concepts such as counting, summing, averaging, finding minimums and maximums, and grouping data.

All queries are stored in individual `.sql` files named by question number for clarity (e.g., `01_suppliers_count.sql`).

## Topics Covered

* Counting rows with `COUNT()`
* Summing values with `SUM()`
* Calculating averages with `AVG()`
* Finding minimum and maximum values with `MIN()` and `MAX()`
* Grouping data with `GROUP BY`
* Filtering grouped data with `HAVING`
* Calculating derived values (e.g., inventory value = unit price × units on hand)
* Sorting results with `ORDER BY`

## Structure

Each `.sql` file corresponds to one question from Workbook 7 and contains the query solution. The exercises cover:

1. Counting the total number of suppliers
2. Calculating the sum of all employee salaries
3. Finding the price of the cheapest product
4. Finding the average price of products
5. Finding the price of the most expensive product
6. Counting the number of products supplied by each supplier
7. Calculating the average price per product category
8. Listing suppliers providing at least 5 products and their counts
9. Calculating and sorting inventory value per product

## Purpose

This repository provides structured practice for mastering aggregate functions and grouping in SQL, helping users summarize and analyze data efficiently in a relational database.
